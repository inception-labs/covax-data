## Distribution File
This file provides information on the vaccination distribution in the MENA region. The data is gathered from: COVAX-distribution, OWID-vaccine-progress, Vaccine-accessibility, Vaccine-eligibility.

- **COVAX-Distribution.csv:** The number of shipments and vaccine doses received by COVAX in each country (AMC eligible), highlighting the exact type of each vaccine. The doses allocated are represented as the doses proportionally received to the total number of population. Most of the figures listed are taken from GAVI website and other credible sources such as: Northafrica post, UNICEF, EMRO and reliefweb.
- **Vaccine-Accessibility.csv:** Data on the registration platform used in each country (online vs. SMS text vs. Electronic health messages) as well as the URL sources for online registration websites.
- **Vaccine-Eligibility.csv:** Data tracking which subpopulations are eligible for vaccination throughout vaccine rollout.
- **Vaccine-Progress.csv:** The number of vaccine doses delivered in each country are drawn from official governmental websites and public offcial statements. Official sources for each country and date can be round in the data repository. Since most available vaccines require two doses, We are reporting two types of vaccine data. The number of people who received at least one vaccine dose are represented by the One-Dose metric, and the number of people who received two vaccine doses are represented in the Total-Vaccinated metric.
